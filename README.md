#Tic Tac Toe

##work process
Literally my whole day but my baby is ready and she works 

I was got by the simple things like not knowing to use

 ```
 this.value = X instead of buttons[i] = X
 
 ```
 
 also as I had little tim towards the end my coding is long and messy for calculating the winner. definitely need to brainstorm a smarter and neater approach.
 
##summary
* works well can be used. 
* stops and announces the winner. 
* Does not allow overwiting of buttons
* gives option to restart with astart button
